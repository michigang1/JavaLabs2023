Minnesang (German: [ˈmɪnəˌzaŋ]; "love song")
 was a tradition of lyric- and song-writing in Germany and Austria that flourished
  in the Middle High German period. This period of medieval German literature began in the 12th century and continued into the 14th. People who wrote and performed Minnesang
  were known as Minnesänger (German: [ˈmɪnəˌzɛŋɐ]), and a single song was called a Minnelied (German: [ˈmɪnəˌliːt]).
